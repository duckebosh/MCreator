## MCreator Project

For stable editions [visit this website](https://mcreator.net/). These files are not as advanced, but they could be less buggy. 

The idea of **this** site is for updated versions of MCreator forked by myself. It's open source! 

### What is MCreator

MCreator allows anyone to get started with Minecraft modding. Since it uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI), it takes the huge amount of programming involved away!
